The tiger scares the mice at first, but really has no interest in them, so the mice have fun with the bear, painting a glow-in-the-dark mouse on its bottom for the tiger to attack and leading the tiger on a house-wrecking chase with a steak. The tiger ends up hanging out and smoking cigars with the mice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3287,"logo_path":"/bz6GbCQQXGNE56LTW9dwgksW0Iw.png","name":"Screen Gems","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snap Happy Traps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
