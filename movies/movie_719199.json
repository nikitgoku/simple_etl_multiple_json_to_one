The description read: \"Wen Pulin, a Han Chinese, who first visited Tibet in 1989 and started making documentaries about it (including \"The Sacred Site of Asceticism\") has now made Nga-shod his permanent home. Befriending Pa-dga' the Living Buddha, today he even subsumes shooting films to build bridges and temples with Pa-dga'. His latest documentary on Tibet is a record of a devoted man carrying out his daily religious and secular duties, and in a oblique way, an internal odyssey of the filmmaker himself finding tranquility in his adopted homeland. The film, therefore, like its subject, exudes the effortless serenity of a man at home with his calling and the environment.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y9o1M56yo9givViSV0KAl5DhK8r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pa-dga' Living Buddha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
